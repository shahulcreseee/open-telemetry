# OpenTelemetry

It is a vendor-neutral open-source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, logs. As an industry-standard, it is supported by 40+ observability vendors, integrated by many libraries, services and apps and adopted by a number of end-users.

It doesn't have any Storage backend. The choice of observability tools is left to the client, making it highly versatile. The developer doesn't need to bother much about configuration except few environment variables which will be one time activity.
